Repeatedly running tests
This is done with command line flags to the test program. The flags we are interested in include:
  --gtest_filter=<test string>
  --gtest_break_on_failure
  --gtest_repeat=2


Tests can be filtered using the --gtest_filter flag. The flag accepts a single string value that uses *'s, :'s, and -'s to help specify a filter for which tests to run.

* is the wildcard character and matches all text

Examples:

./tests --gtest_filter=*                        runs all tests
./tests --gtest_filter=BoxTest.*                runs all tests that are a part of the BoxTest suite.
./tests --gtest_filter=BoxTest.*Dimension*      runs all tests in the BoxTest suite with "Dimension" in their name


: is used to separate filters

Examples:

./tests --gtest_filter=BoxTest.*Copy:BoxTest.Operator*      runs all tests in the BoxTest suite that end in "Copy" or start with "Operator"


- is used to remove tests from a filtered list.

Examples:

./tests --gtest_filter=BoxTest.*-BoxTest.Constructor*       runs all tests in the BoxTest suite except those starting with "Constructor"
