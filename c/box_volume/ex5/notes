Example showing test fixtures
1. Use test fixtures when you have code being repeated for each test case
2. Create a new class that will hold the fixture's shared data. Name it FooTest as practice. Derive the public interface from the testing::Test Class.
3. Each test case gets a new BoxTest object, so previous test cases dont affect future test cases
4. Shared data members must be public or protected so the fixture can access them.
5. Use the SetUp() method to initialize the data members and perform the common setup code.
6. Use the TearDown() method to clean up or destroy objects created in SetUp() method.
7. Use TEST_F instead of TEST macro
8. First argument of the TEST_F macro is the name of the class holding the fixture's data.
